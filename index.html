      <p>
        Can innovation be a passion? Ok how about creativity, can that be a passion? Well after spending many years searching for a passion and feeling confused when I couldn’t answer that question, I discovered my passion is creatively creating.  It is effortless for me to take someone’s ideas, mix in my magic, then produce a finished good better than we all imagined.
